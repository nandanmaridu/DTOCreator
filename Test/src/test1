Iâ€™d like to bring to your attention a recent issue we encountered regarding the marker load process.

We received two markers within a 3-minute interval. The first marker initiated processing and took approximately 30 minutes to complete. Due to this, the second marker's load only began after the first one had fully finished, resulting in a noticeable delay.

Root Cause:
Currently, the system is configured to calculate 10 days' worth of panels during the marker load. This extensive range significantly increases processing time, especially when multiple markers arrive in quick succession.

Proposed Fix:
To improve performance, I suggest limiting the calculation to only the panels relevant to the specific marker being processed, rather than the full 10-day window. This should reduce load time and prevent delays in handling subsequent markers.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this approach further or have any concerns.
